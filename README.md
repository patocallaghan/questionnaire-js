# Questionnaire-js

While working at [Terabyte Interactive](http://www.terabyte.co.nz) I implemented a Questionnaire flow [here](https://www.nzte.govt.nz/en/export/export-ready-questionnaire/). Some of the business logic and validations were quite complex which made building it quite tricky. At the time I didn't use a JS MV* framework but always wondered how different building it would have been if I had. 

Taking a cue from [ToDoMVC](http://www.todomvc.com) I've decided (when I have time) to try and rewrite the Questionnaire using different MV* frameworks. Rather than just building a to-do list this will give me a better *real world* example and allow me to better judge selecting a framework when the need be.

Frameworks I'd like to try:

* [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org)
* [EmberJS](http://www.emberjs.com)
* [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com)
* [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Requirements

* Questionnaire must be flexible i.e. It can't be hardcoded. It can have as many steps or substeps as need me.
